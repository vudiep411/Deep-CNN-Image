# Deep CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
A sample image classifier using tensorflow and keras. I used it on a male and female dataset but can also do it on virtually any dataset

# Installation
Install tensorflow version 2.10.x to use GPU acceleration
```sh
pip install "tensorflow<2.11"
```

Install other libraries
